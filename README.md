# Terraform S3 Bucket

This Terraform module will create a secure S3 bucket suitable for application
blob storage. Each bucket is encrypted with a unique KMS key. Bucket and key
policies are set to allow access only by the configured principals. Public
access blocks are enabled to prevent anything in the bucket from accidentally
becoming public.

Example:

``` terraform
module "bucket" {
  source = "github.com/thoughtbot/aws-s3-bucket?ref=v0.1.0"

  name            = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  trust_principal = aws_iam_role.myservice.arn
}
```

The outputs include `policy_json`, which you can attach to an IAM policy or role
to permit reading and writing the bucket.
